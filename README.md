# Bank Account Helper!

 * Run the app from the server (ex. localhost:3000). This will bring you to the root page.
 * You can add, delete, and see all the transactions from the root page.
 * Your account balance will be shown at the bottom of the transaction list.
 * Be careful not to go under $0.00 or you will have to read a snarky comment.
